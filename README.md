# NewsAnalyzer AI â€“ GenAI Research Tool

NewsAnalyzer AI is a user-friendly GenAI-powered research tool that extracts, analyses, and answers questions from online news articles. Users can input article URLs and ask questions to receive relevant insights using Google Gemini LLM, LangChain, and FAISS for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Features

- Load URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
- Process article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
- Construct an embedding vector using Gemini's embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
- Interact with the LLM's (Gemini) by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.


## Installation

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
  https://github.com/rajashekar6355/NewsAnalyzer-AI.git
```
2.Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd NewsAnalyzer-AI
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.Set up your Gemini API key by creating a .env file in the project root and adding your API

```bash
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
## Usage/Examples

1. Run the Streamlit app by executing:
```bash
streamlit run main.py

```

2.The web app will open in your browser.

- On the sidebar, you can input URLs directly.

- Initiate the data loading and processing by clicking "Process URLs."

- Observe the system as it performs text splitting, generates embedding vectors, and efficiently indexes them using FAISS.

- The embeddings will be stored and indexed using FAISS, enhancing retrieval speed.

- The FAISS index will be saved in a local file path in pickle format for future use.
- One can now ask a question and get the answer based on those news articles
